# Generating-Spacers-with-Nerual-Network
This project recorded the models and experiments taken to identify Pam and spacers in CRISPR locus

1. Background
   CRISPR indicates Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats, which is also an important part of CRISPR-cas system acting as a Immune System of Bacteria and Acheal, and ispiring recent Eukaryotic Gene Editing techonic.
   When bacteria were invaded by other virus or bacteriophages, pieces of their genomic sequence would be cut down into a small piece of 20-50 base pair length, and storaged in a special part of bacteria, named as CRISPR locus. Thereafter, when invaded by the same kind of virus, the bacteria would use those pieces to identify and broke them using specific proteins.
   
2. Objection
   Find such pieces call spacers used as ids of virus in their genome.
